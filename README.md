<h1>Assignments: Tuples</h1>
<hr>
<h3>1. Tuple Mastery in Python</h3>

<h6>Objective:</h6> The aim of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of tuples in Python.

<h5>Task 1: Formatting Flight Itineraries</h5> Create a Python function that takes a list of tuples as an argument. Each tuple contains information about a flight itinerary: (traveler_name, origin, destination). The function should format and return a string that lists each itinerary. For example, if the input is `[("Alice", "New York", "London"), ("Bob", "Tokyo", "San Francisco")]`, the output should be a string formatted as:

```
"Itinerary 1: Alice - From New York to London
 Itinerary 2: Bob - From Tokyo to San Francisco"
 ```

<h3> 2. Python Data Structure Challenges in Real-World Scenarios</h3>

<h5>Task 1: Library System Enhancement</h5> Sharpen your skills in managing and modifying data within tuples and lists.

<h6>Problem Statement:</h6> You are maintaining a library system where each book is stored as a tuple within a list. Your task is to update this system by adding new books and ensuring no duplicates.

Existing Library Data:

```
library = [("1984", "George Orwell"), ("Brave New World", "Aldous Huxley")]
```

- Add functionality to insert new books into `library`. Ensure that adding a duplicate book is handled appropriately.

<h3>3. Mastering Tuple Packing and Unpacking in Python</h3>

<h6>Objective:</h6> The goal of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of tuple packing and unpacking in Python.

<h5>Task 1:</h5> Customer Order Processing Refine your skills in tuple unpacking by managing customer orders.

<h6>Problem Statement:</h6> You are given a list of tuples, each representing a customer's order. Each tuple contains the customer's name, the product ordered, and the quantity. Your task is to unpack each tuple and print the order details in a user-friendly format.
<br><br>

Sample Order Data:

```
orders = [
    ("Alice", "Laptop", 1),
    ("Bob", "Camera", 2),
    # More orders...
]
```

- Write a function to iterate over the list of orders. - Unpack each tuple in the list and format the details for display.

<h6>NOTE:</h6> Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, print statements, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
